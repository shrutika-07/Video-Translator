00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Hey everyone, welcome back, welcome to another exciting video

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,300
and in this video, we are going to make our own video subtitle generator app using AI

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
so basically what we are going to achieve in this video is

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,300
if we have a video, let's say like you watch my videos and those videos are in Hindi language

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,700
so what I want is that I have an AI tool to process my videos

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,900
and generate subtitles in English language

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,400
so that non-Hindi speakers can also watch my videos by reading subtitles

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,400
so just to set the context first, if you have watched my live stream video yesterday

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,900
then I have given you this challenge that if you can make this, it will be really cool

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,900
so like this is a real problem that all the content creators face and I personally face

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,400
and all the online tools like capwing, wheat are very expensive

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,400
so I thought let's make our own and make a video or a tutorial that how I made this

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,900
so let's start with the video

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,900
before starting the video, let's take an overview of what we are going to do

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,400
how we are going to approach this

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
so basically what we are going to do is we are going to use docker

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
so we have a docker container

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,400
what we are going to do is we are going to use Ubuntu image in this

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,900
we are going to install some tools in this

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,900
so what we are going to do is we are going to install some video file in docker container

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,900
and in return what we are going to do is we are going to make a text file

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,900
a text file and an SRT file

23
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,900
in which our transcriptions and I can say our subtitles will be there

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,900
and it can be that whatever we are going to do in the video is in any language

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
like Hindi, Punjabi or any language

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,900
and in return what we are going to do is we are going to generate subtitles in English language

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
so this is our approach

28
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,900
and for this what we are going to do is we are going to use whisper AI

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
so if you don't know what is whisper AI

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
whisper AI is basically a large language model

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,900
that works on videos or on audios

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,900
and this is completely open source

33
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
and free of cost

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,900
so if you want to read its architecture

35
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
then you can read it here

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,900
so in this you can see that if the user says this

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
then you can generate English transcriptions

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,900
you can generate any to English transcriptions

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,900
for example the user is talking in any language

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,900
and the transcriptions that are being made are in English language

41
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,900
and this is exactly what we want

42
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
so let's start from the coding part

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,900
I didn't want to waste much time here

44
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,900
so we are going to use this and this is free of cost

45
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
so for this video tutorial

46
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
I have recorded a sample video here

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
this is in Hindi language

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
so let me show you the video

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
so let me play it

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
welcome

51
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
so this is a sample video

52
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
which is going to be in Hindi

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
and we will try to generate subtitles

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
of this Hindi video

55
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
in English language

56
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,900
so that our non-Hindi speaking audience

57
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
can enjoy this video

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
so let's see

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,900
how our English subtitles

60
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
come out

61
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
so this is our video

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
which we are going to translate

63
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
so let's do one thing

64
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
let's open our terminal

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,900
this is our terminal

66
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
and we will make a new project

67
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
in the coding folder

68
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
so we will call it video translator

69
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,900
so this is our server video translator

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,900
and in this I will do cd

71
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,900
video translator

72
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,900
and code dot

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,900
which will open my vscode

74
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,900
so as per our architecture

75
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
we need to make a docker container

76
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
so let's do one thing

77
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,900
let's make a docker file

78
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,900
and just in case you don't know docker

79
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,900
you never worked with docker

80
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,900
so what you can do is you can just head over

81
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
to learn.pushkar.dev

82
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,900
and you can just get at my course of docker

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
I will put the link in the description

84
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
so here is the course

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
so in this we have covered

86
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,900
the docker from absolute beginner

87
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,900
to advanced level

88
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,900
but please consider this course

89
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,900
so you can see this course

90
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,900
back to the topic

91
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
so what we are going to do

92
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
I will assume that you already know docker

93
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,900
so what we are going to do is

94
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,900
we will take a base image here first

95
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,900
as I told you

96
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
we will take a base image here

97
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,900
what it means is that we will do it inside

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
now we have to use this whisper ai

99
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
it is very simple

100
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
what we have to do is

101
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,900
first we have to install the whisper ai

102
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
so that is we have to install pip

103
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,900
which is ok

104
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
after that what we have to do is

105
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
we have to install some tools here

106
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
just like ffmpeg

107
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
so internally we have to use ffmpeg

108
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
and we have to install ffmpeg

109
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
inside our docker container

110
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
and we have to install this too

111
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
after that that's it

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
we are ready to go

113
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
after that you can see what we have to do

114
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
we have to say whisper

115
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,900
whatever audio video file we have to give

116
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
it will be in hindi language

117
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
and we will say

118
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,900
task translate

119
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,900
so what it will do is translate it in english

120
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,900
if we don't give this task

121
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
then what it will do is

122
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
the language in which we have this video

123
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,900
will generate the same subtitles

124
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
what we can do is we can make two translations

125
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,900
we can make hindi subtitles

126
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,900
and we can make english subtitles

127
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,900
so this is going to be really cool

128
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
so let's start it quickly

129
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
so what we have to do is

130
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
finally we want to do a command run

131
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,900
that is apt update

132
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,900
so our packages will be updated

133
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
and after that what we are going to do is

134
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
we are going to do apt install ffmpeg

135
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
so what we have to do inside this docker container

136
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
we have to install ffmpeg

137
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
plus we have to install python

138
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
so here you can quickly search

139
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
like python install

140
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,900
in ubuntu

141
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
so how we can install python

142
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
in ubuntu

143
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
so let's see in documentation

144
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
after apt update

145
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,900
we just have to run this command

146
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,900
and python will be installed

147
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,900
we can say and and python 3

148
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,900
and similarly we will install

149
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,900
pip install in ubuntu

150
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
so we can see

151
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
how we can install pip

152
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
so we just have to write apt install this thing

153
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
so here I can say and and this

154
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
and make sure

155
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
that we have a command of hyphen y

156
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
or else it will ask us

157
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,900
if we have to install it or not

158
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
so as soon as we

159
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,900
run this thing our packages are installed

160
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
now what we have to do is

161
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
we have to install visper ai

162
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
inside our machine

163
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
so I will do this command copy

164
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,900
and we will do run and this

165
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,900
so what will it do? it will install

166
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
my open ai visper

167
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
inside my docker container

168
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
and after that we will run

169
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,900
so we will say run and this

170
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
that's it our visper ai setup is done

171
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
now we will say entry point

172
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
and here we will say bash

173
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
if you run this container

174
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
then it will run from bash

175
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,900
ideally we should run visper

176
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
but I want to show you

177
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,900
how things work so here we can

178
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
keep it bash

179
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,900
now make sure that your docker demon is running

180
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
so till this point my docker demon

181
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
was still closed so I just run

182
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
docker demon

183
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
so you can see that my docker is running

184
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,900
so docker is now running

185
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,900
so now we just have to write a command

186
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
then I will say build

187
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,900
tag

188
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
and we will say my visper

189
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,900
okay we can name it

190
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
and dot

191
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
dot means the path where this docker file is

192
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
and enter

193
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
now this thing will take some time because

194
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,900
it will first fetch ubuntu and then

195
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,900
install all these things and then our

196
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,900
container will be built

197
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
which we can use for our translations

198
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,900
so this thing is going to take a lot of time

199
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
because ubuntu

200
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
you can see that ubuntu is getting

201
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
pulled if you already have ubuntu

202
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
right if you already have ubuntu

203
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,900
pulled then it will not take that much time

204
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,900
but because this is my first time

205
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,900
pulling this so it is taking time

206
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,900
so it's okay we can wait

207
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
so we wait on this

208
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
cool so now you can see that our docker

209
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
is set up if I come back

210
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,900
then you will see that we have an image

211
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,900
that is my visper

212
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
so this is our custom image that we just made

213
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
now we can use it

214
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,900
here my desktop

215
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
if I go to my terminal

216
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,900
and I do a series

217
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,900
dot dot

218
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
so here if I go to my desktop

219
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
okay so what I will do here quickly

220
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
I will make a folder on the desktop

221
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
which I will name it sample

222
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
samples

223
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900
so I know that you cannot see

224
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
this particular thing

225
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,900
so here if I do ls then you will see that

226
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
here we have a folder sample

227
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,900
so if I do cd in sample

228
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
so here this is our file

229
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
which we have to translate

230
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
right so in this file

231
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
let's rename this file

232
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
we will call it sample.mov

233
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
so if I do ls again

234
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
you can see that this is our MOV file

235
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
which I showed you just now

236
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
so now what we can do is we just have to run our container

237
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
so what I will do is

238
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
first we copy this file path

239
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
so this is the file

240
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
so here we right click get info

241
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
so first we copy this file

242
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
so I have done this copy

243
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,900
so here we will do docker run

244
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,900
interactive

245
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
volume mapping

246
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
okay I hope that you can see the command

247
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
I will zoom in also

248
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
okay volume mapping

249
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
so you map this volume

250
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
slash home slash videos

251
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,900
and after that we have to run which container

252
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
that is mywhisper

253
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
so my-whisper

254
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
so this was our container

255
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
so we will run it and enter

256
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
this is our container up and running

257
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
if you do ls and I go to

258
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
cd-home

259
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
and in cd-home I go to

260
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
and I can go to like

261
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,900
you can see that here we can go

262
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
in videos if I do ls

263
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
then you can see that in our container

264
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
I am able to access that file

265
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
so what we have to do is we just have to write

266
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
whisper here

267
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
our file name sample.mov

268
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
and after that we will mention that

269
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
which is our language

270
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
so these are the examples and in which you can see

271
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
Hindi is also included okay these are the languages

272
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
so here I can say hyphen hyphen language

273
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,900
okay hyphen hyphen language

274
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,900
that is Hindi with a capital H

275
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
then we will call it task

276
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
so everything is translated from documentation

277
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
so as soon as I do this

278
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
and I will press enter

279
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
now this thing is going to take a lot of time

280
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
the reason being is because we

281
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,900
basically what happens is because this is an AI

282
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
so AI models need GPU

283
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
and my machine is not having

284
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
GPU okay so it works

285
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
very slow on CPU

286
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
but in reality obviously you will deploy this thing

287
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
on a cloud okay so we will deploy it on a cloud

288
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
so we should have

289
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
GPU instances there but okay for this

290
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
demonstration you can try this way

291
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
if you have GPU then this thing is going to be very fast

292
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
but if your machine doesn't have GPU

293
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
then this thing is going to be slow

294
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
so now you can see that

295
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
how our subtitles are

296
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
and it really took just one minute

297
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
okay so here you can see

298
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
yes welcome so this is a sample video

299
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
which is going to be in

300
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
in shudh hindi and we will try that

301
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
so if you will look carefully

302
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,900
what he did, he gave me this MOV

303
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,900
file which I will tell you again

304
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
so it was in Hindi right if I play it again

305
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
yes welcome

306
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,900
so this is a sample video

307
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
which is going to be in shudh hindi

308
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
and we will try that

309
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
we can generate subtitles of this shudh hindi video

310
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,900
in English language

311
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
so that our non-hindi

312
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
speaking audience can enjoy this video

313
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
so let's see

314
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
how our English subtitles

315
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
come out

316
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
right so you can see that

317
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,900
he did a very good job

318
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
and what he did in return

319
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,900
he did some sample videos right you can see that

320
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
if I open this json okay open with

321
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
vs code so you can see that if I

322
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
format this document so you can see that

323
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
what he did he said that

324
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
from 0 to 2 you said yes welcome

325
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
so this is a timestamp okay

326
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
so this is a sample video and it started

327
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,900
at this time and ended at this time

328
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
so if you can do it through any video

329
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
processing you can put subtitles on it

330
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
okay here one more thing that I want

331
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
to do is if I can just attach

332
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
the subtitles here itself

333
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,900
because if you have seen carefully

334
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
we also have srt file

335
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
we also have vtt file

336
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
so what are these vtt files

337
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
these are basically our translation files

338
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
so you can see that as it is

339
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,900
you can upload it on youtube

340
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
automatically it will make subtitles

341
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
so here if I go to my quicktime player

342
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
I am not sure if we can

343
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
do this for subtitles

344
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
so here like option should be

345
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
subtitles are like none okay

346
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
so let's do one thing let's go to chrome

347
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
okay so here I will say that

348
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
let's say we open any service

349
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,900
let's say maybe weed okay so let's open

350
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
weed.io so here

351
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
I upload the video first okay

352
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
by the way weed.io is a

353
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
like AI tool so here we will upload

354
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
so in the desktop

355
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
in the sample we will open it

356
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
okay so let's open this thing

357
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
let's open it here

358
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
here I will go to subtitles

359
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
so here I will say manual okay here

360
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
we can upload our own file so upload

361
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
okay and here I will say that

362
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
to upload

363
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Hindi is okay import

364
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
so to import what we have to give

365
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
we have to give srt file

366
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
what it was like

367
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
let's go back so it says

368
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
that yeah so we can upload srt file

369
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
so let's upload this file

370
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
okay I didn't do anything I

371
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,900
uploaded the file that our AI generated

372
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
now let's play it

373
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
welcome

374
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,900
so this is a sample video which will be

375
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
in pure Hindi and we will try

376
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,900
that we can generate subtitles

377
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
of this pure Hindi video

378
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
in English language

379
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
so that our non-hindi speaking audience

380
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
can enjoy this video

381
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
so let's see that this video

382
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
how our English subtitles

383
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
come out

384
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
so as you have already seen

385
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
that we were able to

386
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
generate subtitles

387
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
that is also free of cost

388
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,900
so we used whisper here

389
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
and for this video

390
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,900
it is a very short video in which

391
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I wanted to show you how you can achieve this

392
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
particular thing and now what I am planning

393
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
is that I will make a web application

394
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
in which we will do this on cloud

395
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
so what you can do is like you can connect

396
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
because obviously these things are coming

397
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
like this will charge you money because

398
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
one CPU is running on the cloud

399
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
so like you can upload a video

400
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
you can pay the money and then

401
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
the subtitles will come out in different languages

402
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
so this thing was that simple to do

403
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
and I hope you enjoyed the video
