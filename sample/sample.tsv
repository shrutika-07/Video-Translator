0	3300	Hey everyone, welcome back, welcome to another exciting video
3300	9300	and in this video, we are going to make our own video subtitle generator app using AI
9300	12300	so basically what we are going to achieve in this video is
12300	18300	if we have a video, let's say like you watch my videos and those videos are in Hindi language
18300	22700	so what I want is that I have an AI tool to process my videos
22700	27900	and generate subtitles in English language
27900	33400	so that non-Hindi speakers can also watch my videos by reading subtitles
33400	37400	so just to set the context first, if you have watched my live stream video yesterday
37400	41900	then I have given you this challenge that if you can make this, it will be really cool
41900	46900	so like this is a real problem that all the content creators face and I personally face
46900	52400	and all the online tools like capwing, wheat are very expensive
52400	58400	so I thought let's make our own and make a video or a tutorial that how I made this
58400	59900	so let's start with the video
59900	63900	before starting the video, let's take an overview of what we are going to do
63900	66400	how we are going to approach this
66400	69400	so basically what we are going to do is we are going to use docker
69400	71400	so we have a docker container
71400	78400	what we are going to do is we are going to use Ubuntu image in this
78400	80900	we are going to install some tools in this
80900	86900	so what we are going to do is we are going to install some video file in docker container
86900	89900	and in return what we are going to do is we are going to make a text file
89900	92900	a text file and an SRT file
92900	96900	in which our transcriptions and I can say our subtitles will be there
96900	100900	and it can be that whatever we are going to do in the video is in any language
100900	102900	like Hindi, Punjabi or any language
102900	108900	and in return what we are going to do is we are going to generate subtitles in English language
108900	110900	so this is our approach
110900	114900	and for this what we are going to do is we are going to use whisper AI
114900	117900	so if you don't know what is whisper AI
117900	120900	whisper AI is basically a large language model
120900	123900	that works on videos or on audios
123900	125900	and this is completely open source
125900	127900	and free of cost
127900	130900	so if you want to read its architecture
130900	131900	then you can read it here
131900	133900	so in this you can see that if the user says this
133900	135900	then you can generate English transcriptions
135900	138900	you can generate any to English transcriptions
138900	141900	for example the user is talking in any language
141900	144900	and the transcriptions that are being made are in English language
144900	146900	and this is exactly what we want
146900	149900	so let's start from the coding part
149900	151900	I didn't want to waste much time here
151900	154900	so we are going to use this and this is free of cost
154900	156900	so for this video tutorial
156900	158900	I have recorded a sample video here
158900	160900	this is in Hindi language
160900	162900	so let me show you the video
162900	164900	so let me play it
166900	168900	welcome
168900	170900	so this is a sample video
170900	172900	which is going to be in Hindi
172900	174900	and we will try to generate subtitles
174900	176900	of this Hindi video
176900	178900	in English language
178900	180900	so that our non-Hindi speaking audience
180900	182900	can enjoy this video
182900	184900	so let's see
184900	186900	how our English subtitles
186900	188900	come out
189900	191900	so this is our video
191900	193900	which we are going to translate
193900	195900	so let's do one thing
195900	197900	let's open our terminal
197900	199900	this is our terminal
199900	201900	and we will make a new project
201900	203900	in the coding folder
203900	205900	so we will call it video translator
205900	207900	so this is our server video translator
207900	209900	and in this I will do cd
209900	211900	video translator
211900	213900	and code dot
213900	215900	which will open my vscode
215900	217900	so as per our architecture
217900	219900	we need to make a docker container
219900	221900	so let's do one thing
221900	223900	let's make a docker file
223900	225900	and just in case you don't know docker
225900	227900	you never worked with docker
227900	229900	so what you can do is you can just head over
229900	231900	to learn.pushkar.dev
231900	233900	and you can just get at my course of docker
233900	235900	I will put the link in the description
235900	237900	so here is the course
237900	239900	so in this we have covered
239900	241900	the docker from absolute beginner
241900	243900	to advanced level
243900	245900	but please consider this course
245900	247900	so you can see this course
247900	249900	back to the topic
249900	251900	so what we are going to do
251900	253900	I will assume that you already know docker
253900	255900	so what we are going to do is
255900	257900	we will take a base image here first
257900	259900	as I told you
259900	261900	we will take a base image here
261900	263900	what it means is that we will do it inside
263900	265900	now we have to use this whisper ai
265900	267900	it is very simple
267900	269900	what we have to do is
269900	271900	first we have to install the whisper ai
271900	273900	so that is we have to install pip
273900	275900	which is ok
275900	277900	after that what we have to do is
277900	279900	we have to install some tools here
279900	281900	just like ffmpeg
281900	283900	so internally we have to use ffmpeg
283900	285900	and we have to install ffmpeg
285900	287900	inside our docker container
287900	289900	and we have to install this too
289900	291900	after that that's it
291900	293900	we are ready to go
293900	295900	after that you can see what we have to do
295900	297900	we have to say whisper
297900	299900	whatever audio video file we have to give
299900	301900	it will be in hindi language
301900	303900	and we will say
303900	305900	task translate
305900	307900	so what it will do is translate it in english
307900	309900	if we don't give this task
309900	311900	then what it will do is
311900	313900	the language in which we have this video
313900	315900	will generate the same subtitles
315900	317900	what we can do is we can make two translations
317900	319900	we can make hindi subtitles
319900	321900	and we can make english subtitles
321900	323900	so this is going to be really cool
323900	325900	so let's start it quickly
325900	327900	so what we have to do is
327900	329900	finally we want to do a command run
329900	331900	that is apt update
331900	333900	so our packages will be updated
333900	335900	and after that what we are going to do is
335900	337900	we are going to do apt install ffmpeg
337900	339900	so what we have to do inside this docker container
339900	341900	we have to install ffmpeg
341900	343900	plus we have to install python
343900	345900	so here you can quickly search
345900	347900	like python install
347900	349900	in ubuntu
349900	351900	so how we can install python
351900	353900	in ubuntu
353900	355900	so let's see in documentation
355900	357900	after apt update
357900	359900	we just have to run this command
359900	361900	and python will be installed
361900	363900	we can say and and python 3
363900	365900	and similarly we will install
365900	367900	pip install in ubuntu
367900	369900	so we can see
369900	371900	how we can install pip
371900	373900	so we just have to write apt install this thing
373900	375900	so here I can say and and this
375900	377900	and make sure
377900	379900	that we have a command of hyphen y
379900	381900	or else it will ask us
381900	383900	if we have to install it or not
383900	385900	so as soon as we
385900	387900	run this thing our packages are installed
387900	389900	now what we have to do is
389900	391900	we have to install visper ai
391900	393900	inside our machine
393900	395900	so I will do this command copy
395900	397900	and we will do run and this
397900	399900	so what will it do? it will install
399900	401900	my open ai visper
401900	403900	inside my docker container
403900	405900	and after that we will run
405900	407900	so we will say run and this
407900	409900	that's it our visper ai setup is done
409900	411900	now we will say entry point
411900	413900	and here we will say bash
413900	415900	if you run this container
415900	417900	then it will run from bash
417900	419900	ideally we should run visper
419900	421900	but I want to show you
421900	423900	how things work so here we can
423900	425900	keep it bash
425900	427900	now make sure that your docker demon is running
427900	429900	so till this point my docker demon
429900	431900	was still closed so I just run
431900	433900	docker demon
433900	435900	so you can see that my docker is running
435900	437900	so docker is now running
437900	439900	so now we just have to write a command
439900	441900	then I will say build
441900	443900	tag
443900	445900	and we will say my visper
445900	447900	okay we can name it
447900	449900	and dot
449900	451900	dot means the path where this docker file is
451900	453900	and enter
453900	455900	now this thing will take some time because
455900	457900	it will first fetch ubuntu and then
457900	459900	install all these things and then our
459900	461900	container will be built
461900	463900	which we can use for our translations
463900	465900	so this thing is going to take a lot of time
465900	467900	because ubuntu
467900	469900	you can see that ubuntu is getting
469900	471900	pulled if you already have ubuntu
471900	473900	right if you already have ubuntu
473900	475900	pulled then it will not take that much time
475900	477900	but because this is my first time
477900	479900	pulling this so it is taking time
479900	481900	so it's okay we can wait
481900	483900	so we wait on this
483900	485900	cool so now you can see that our docker
485900	487900	is set up if I come back
487900	489900	then you will see that we have an image
489900	491900	that is my visper
491900	493900	so this is our custom image that we just made
493900	495900	now we can use it
495900	497900	here my desktop
497900	499900	if I go to my terminal
499900	501900	and I do a series
501900	503900	dot dot
503900	505900	so here if I go to my desktop
505900	507900	okay so what I will do here quickly
507900	509900	I will make a folder on the desktop
509900	511900	which I will name it sample
511900	513900	samples
513900	515900	so I know that you cannot see
515900	517900	this particular thing
517900	519900	so here if I do ls then you will see that
519900	521900	here we have a folder sample
521900	523900	so if I do cd in sample
523900	525900	so here this is our file
525900	527900	which we have to translate
527900	529900	right so in this file
529900	531900	let's rename this file
531900	533900	we will call it sample.mov
533900	535900	so if I do ls again
535900	537900	you can see that this is our MOV file
537900	539900	which I showed you just now
539900	541900	so now what we can do is we just have to run our container
541900	543900	so what I will do is
543900	545900	first we copy this file path
545900	547900	so this is the file
547900	549900	so here we right click get info
549900	551900	so first we copy this file
551900	553900	so I have done this copy
553900	555900	so here we will do docker run
555900	557900	interactive
557900	559900	volume mapping
559900	561900	okay I hope that you can see the command
561900	563900	I will zoom in also
563900	565900	okay volume mapping
565900	567900	so you map this volume
567900	569900	slash home slash videos
569900	571900	and after that we have to run which container
571900	573900	that is mywhisper
573900	575900	so my-whisper
575900	577900	so this was our container
577900	579900	so we will run it and enter
579900	581900	this is our container up and running
581900	583900	if you do ls and I go to
583900	585900	cd-home
585900	587900	and in cd-home I go to
587900	589900	and I can go to like
589900	591900	you can see that here we can go
591900	593900	in videos if I do ls
593900	595900	then you can see that in our container
595900	597900	I am able to access that file
597900	599900	so what we have to do is we just have to write
599900	601900	whisper here
601900	603900	our file name sample.mov
603900	605900	and after that we will mention that
605900	607900	which is our language
607900	609900	so these are the examples and in which you can see
609900	611900	Hindi is also included okay these are the languages
611900	613900	so here I can say hyphen hyphen language
613900	615900	okay hyphen hyphen language
615900	617900	that is Hindi with a capital H
617900	619900	then we will call it task
619900	621900	so everything is translated from documentation
621900	623900	so as soon as I do this
623900	625900	and I will press enter
625900	627900	now this thing is going to take a lot of time
627900	629900	the reason being is because we
629900	631900	basically what happens is because this is an AI
631900	633900	so AI models need GPU
633900	635900	and my machine is not having
635900	637900	GPU okay so it works
637900	639900	very slow on CPU
639900	641900	but in reality obviously you will deploy this thing
641900	643900	on a cloud okay so we will deploy it on a cloud
643900	645900	so we should have
645900	647900	GPU instances there but okay for this
647900	649900	demonstration you can try this way
649900	651900	if you have GPU then this thing is going to be very fast
651900	653900	but if your machine doesn't have GPU
653900	655900	then this thing is going to be slow
655900	657900	so now you can see that
657900	659900	how our subtitles are
659900	661900	and it really took just one minute
661900	663900	okay so here you can see
663900	665900	yes welcome so this is a sample video
665900	667900	which is going to be in
667900	669900	in shudh hindi and we will try that
669900	671900	so if you will look carefully
671900	673900	what he did, he gave me this MOV
673900	675900	file which I will tell you again
675900	677900	so it was in Hindi right if I play it again
677900	679900	yes welcome
679900	681900	so this is a sample video
681900	683900	which is going to be in shudh hindi
683900	685900	and we will try that
685900	687900	we can generate subtitles of this shudh hindi video
687900	689900	in English language
689900	691900	so that our non-hindi
691900	693900	speaking audience can enjoy this video
693900	695900	so let's see
695900	697900	how our English subtitles
697900	699900	come out
699900	701900	right so you can see that
701900	703900	he did a very good job
703900	705900	and what he did in return
705900	707900	he did some sample videos right you can see that
707900	709900	if I open this json okay open with
709900	711900	vs code so you can see that if I
711900	713900	format this document so you can see that
713900	715900	what he did he said that
715900	717900	from 0 to 2 you said yes welcome
717900	719900	so this is a timestamp okay
719900	721900	so this is a sample video and it started
721900	723900	at this time and ended at this time
723900	725900	so if you can do it through any video
725900	727900	processing you can put subtitles on it
727900	729900	okay here one more thing that I want
729900	731900	to do is if I can just attach
731900	733900	the subtitles here itself
733900	735900	because if you have seen carefully
735900	737900	we also have srt file
737900	739900	we also have vtt file
739900	741900	so what are these vtt files
741900	743900	these are basically our translation files
743900	745900	so you can see that as it is
745900	747900	you can upload it on youtube
747900	749900	automatically it will make subtitles
749900	751900	so here if I go to my quicktime player
751900	753900	I am not sure if we can
753900	755900	do this for subtitles
755900	757900	so here like option should be
757900	759900	subtitles are like none okay
759900	761900	so let's do one thing let's go to chrome
761900	763900	okay so here I will say that
763900	765900	let's say we open any service
765900	767900	let's say maybe weed okay so let's open
767900	769900	weed.io so here
769900	771900	I upload the video first okay
771900	773900	by the way weed.io is a
773900	775900	like AI tool so here we will upload
775900	777900	so in the desktop
777900	779900	in the sample we will open it
779900	781900	okay so let's open this thing
781900	783900	let's open it here
783900	785900	here I will go to subtitles
785900	787900	so here I will say manual okay here
787900	789900	we can upload our own file so upload
789900	791900	okay and here I will say that
791900	793900	to upload
793900	795900	Hindi is okay import
795900	797900	so to import what we have to give
797900	799900	we have to give srt file
799900	801900	what it was like
801900	803900	let's go back so it says
803900	805900	that yeah so we can upload srt file
805900	807900	so let's upload this file
807900	809900	okay I didn't do anything I
809900	811900	uploaded the file that our AI generated
811900	813900	now let's play it
813900	815900	welcome
815900	817900	so this is a sample video which will be
817900	819900	in pure Hindi and we will try
819900	821900	that we can generate subtitles
821900	823900	of this pure Hindi video
823900	825900	in English language
825900	827900	so that our non-hindi speaking audience
827900	829900	can enjoy this video
829900	831900	so let's see that this video
831900	833900	how our English subtitles
833900	835900	come out
835900	837900	so as you have already seen
837900	839900	that we were able to
839900	841900	generate subtitles
841900	843900	that is also free of cost
843900	845900	so we used whisper here
845900	847900	and for this video
847900	849900	it is a very short video in which
849900	851900	I wanted to show you how you can achieve this
851900	853900	particular thing and now what I am planning
853900	855900	is that I will make a web application
855900	857900	in which we will do this on cloud
857900	859900	so what you can do is like you can connect
859900	861900	because obviously these things are coming
861900	863900	like this will charge you money because
863900	865900	one CPU is running on the cloud
865900	867900	so like you can upload a video
867900	869900	you can pay the money and then
869900	871900	the subtitles will come out in different languages
871900	873900	so this thing was that simple to do
873900	875900	and I hope you enjoyed the video
875900	877900	if you liked the video then like and subscribe
877900	879900	do tell in the comments how did you like the video
879900	881900	see you in the next video
881900	883900	until then bye bye take care
